# Introduction

 * Install a Conda environment
 * Install Python packages
 * Run a Python script with that Conda environment and packages

We use only one point of contact, `ormr_folder_name`,
which is the folder where `ormr` installs the Python environment and packages
needed:

```{r}
ormr_folder_name <- tempfile()
ormr_folder_name
```

Initially, nothing is installed, this must be verified

```{r}
testthat::expect_false(
  is_miniconda_installed(ormr_folder_name = ormr_folder_name)
)
```

Time to install Conda (or any other environment):

```{r}
install_miniconda(ormr_folder_name = ormr_folder_name)
testthat::expect_true(
  is_miniconda_installed(ormr_folder_name = ormr_folder_name)
)
```

Get a list of the installed Python packages
(or more likely: a tibble):

```{r}
get_installed_python_packages <- function(folder_name) {
  # ...
}
installed_python_packages <- get_installed_python_packages(
  folder_name = folder_name
)
```

Tensorflow (or any other absent package) will not be in that list yet:

```{r}
package_name <- "tensorflow"
# Or something more elaborate, if 'installed_python_packages' is a tibble
testthat::expect_false(package_name %in% installed_python_packages) 
```


Install it:

```{r}
install_python_packages <- function(folder_name, package_name) {
  # ...
}
install_python_packages(folder_name = folder_name, package_name = package_name)
```

Now the Python package should be installed:

```{r}
installed_python_packages <- get_installed_python_packages(
  folder_name = folder_name
)

# Or something more elaborate, if installed_python_packages is a tibble
testthat::expect_true(package_name %in% installed_python_packages) 
```

Great, with our environment and packages in place,
we run a Python script with those packages with command-line arguments

```
run_python_script <- function(
  folder_name,
  python_script_path,
  args
) {
  # ...
}

python_script_path <- system.file("extdata", "run_gcae.py", package = "ormr")

output <- run_python_script(
  folder_name = folder_name,
  python_script_path = python_script_path,
  args = "--help"
)
testthat::expect_true(length(output) > 0)
```

# Introduction

 * Install a Conda environment
 * Install Python packages
 * Run a Python script with that Conda environment and packages

We use only one point of contact, `folder_name`,
which is the location where the Python environment and packages
are installed:

```{r}
gcae_options <- create_gcae_options(gcae_folder = tempfile())
gcae_options_to_str(gcae_options)
```

Initially, nothing is installed, this must be verified

```{r}
testthat::expect_false(
  is_miniconda_installed(miniconda_path = get_miniconda_path(gcae_options))
)
```

Time to install Conda (or any other environment):

```{r}
install_miniconda(miniconda_path = get_miniconda_path(gcae_options))
testthat::expect_true(
  is_miniconda_installed(
    miniconda_path = get_miniconda_path(gcae_options)
  )
)
```

Get a list of the installed Python packages
(or more likely: a tibble):

```{r}
installed_python_packages <- gcaer::list_python_packages(
  gcae_options = gcae_options
)
knitr::kable(installed_python_packages)
```

Tensorflow (or any other absent package) will not be in that list yet:

```{r}
package_name <- "tensorflow"
testthat::expect_false(package_name %in% installed_python_packages$package) 
```


Install it:

```
install_python_packages(
  gcae_options = gcae_options,
  package_names = package_name
)
```

Now the Python package should be installed:

```
installed_python_packages <- gcaer::list_python_packages(
  gcae_options = gcae_options
)
testthat::expect_true(package_name %in% installed_python_packages$package) 
```

Great, with our environment and packages in place,

run_python_script <- function(

testthat::expect_true(length(output) > 0)
